## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1️⃣ Prerequisites

- **Java 21** installed  
- **Maven 3.9+** installed  
- **Chrome** or another browser   

Check your setup:
```bash
java -version
mvn -version
```

---

### 2️⃣ Clone the Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/sauce-demo.git
cd sauce-demo
```

---

### 3️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
mvn clean install
```

---

## ▶️ Running Tests

Run all feature files with Maven:

```bash
mvn test
```

Or specify a single runner class:

```bash
mvn test -Dcucumber.filter.tags="@cart"
```

> 💡 You can tag your scenarios (`@login`, `@checkout`, `@cart`) in `.feature` files to control which ones run.

---

## 📊 Test Report

After execution, an HTML report is generated automatically.

**Default location:**
```
target/report/cucumber-report.html
```

Open the report in your browser to view results and screenshots.

---

## 🧩 Example Feature

```gherkin
Feature: Add multiple products to cart

  Scenario: Successfully add multiple products to the cart
    When I add the following products to the cart:
      | Sauce Labs Bike Light     |
      | Sauce Labs Fleece Jacket  |
    Then the cart icon should show "2" items
    When I click on the cart icon
    Then I should be redirected to the Cart page titled "Your Cart"
    And I should see the following products in my cart:
      | Sauce Labs Bike Light    |
      | Sauce Labs Fleece Jacket |
```

## 🧠 Key Design Concepts

- **Page Object Model (POM)** for clean test maintenance  
- **Reusable Selenium utilities** for waits, maps, and dynamic element handling  
- **Cucumber BDD** for readable and maintainable test scenarios  
- **Assertions** via JUnit for strong validation logic
